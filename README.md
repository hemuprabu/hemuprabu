## Hi, I'm Hemalatha Prakasam.

I am a Software developer with a Master's degree in computer science. I recently completed a full stack development certificate from UNCC Bootcamp, where I acquired skills in JavaScript, CSS, React.js, responsive web design, and more.

I develop new features and infrastructure to meet rapidly emerging business and project needs. I participate in all aspects of agile software development, including design, implementation, and deployment. I collaborate with designers, front-end engineers, and back-end engineers to create reliable APIs, and I use Slack, GitHub, and frequent videoconferences to collaborate across time zones.

As an innovative problem-solver passionate about app development, I'm currently focusing on mobile-first design and development. Since finishing the bootcamp, I've continued independent studies to delve into iOS and Android development.

# Here's what I bring to every project:
- Problem-solving skills and perseverance
- Creativity and design fundamentals from a minor in graphic design
- Dedication to teamwork and flexible collaboration
- Foundational knowledge of agile software development principles
- Basic understanding of UX/UI principles
- Excitement to utilize my skills as part of a fast-paced, quality-driven team. Letâ€™s connect!
